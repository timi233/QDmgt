# Channel Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### II. CLI Interface
Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### V. Observability
Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Start simple, YAGNI principles

## Additional Constraints

### Security Requirements
- All authentication mechanisms must use industry-standard protocols
- Passwords must be hashed with PBKDF2 or stronger
- All communications must use HTTPS/TLS in production
- Input validation required for all user-provided data
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Performance Standards
- API response time < 200ms p95 for standard operations
- Search performance < 2 seconds for 10,000 channels
- Memory usage < 100MB per service
- Support up to 1,000 concurrent users
- Horizontal scaling capability

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python 3.11 with FastAPI
- Frontend: TypeScript 5.x with React.js
- Database: PostgreSQL 13+
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Testing: pytest, React Testing Library
- Deployment: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Security-sensitive code must be reviewed by security team member
- Performance-critical code must be reviewed by senior developer
- All reviews must verify compliance with constitution principles

### Quality Gates
- Unit test coverage >= 80%
- Integration test coverage >= 70%
- Security scan must pass before merge
- Performance benchmarks must meet standards
- Code linting must pass before merge

### Review Process
- Feature branches must be reviewed before merging to develop
- Develop branch must be reviewed before merging to main
- Hotfixes must follow emergency review process
- All breaking changes must be documented and approved

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance
