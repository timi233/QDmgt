# Tasks: Channel Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-channel-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths shown below assume the planned web application structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure with backend and frontend directories
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with FastAPI dependencies in backend/
- [ ] T003 Initialize Node.js project with React dependencies in frontend/
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools for Python and TypeScript
- [ ] T005 Set up database migration framework (Alembic for PostgreSQL)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Setup PostgreSQL database schema and initial migrations
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework in backend/src/auth/
- [ ] T008 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure in backend/src/api/
- [ ] T009 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on in backend/src/models/
- [ ] T010 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure in backend/src/utils/
- [ ] T011 Setup environment configuration management in backend/src/config/
- [ ] T012 [P] Create base UI components in frontend/src/components/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Channel CRUD Operations (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Allow administrators to create, read, update, and delete channel records with basic information.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow an admin to create a new channel, view the list of channels, update channel details, and remove channels.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create Channel model in backend/src/models/channel.py
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create User model in backend/src/models/user.py
- [ ] T015 [US1] Create Channel service in backend/src/services/channel_service.py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Create Channel API endpoints in backend/src/api/channels.py
- [ ] T017 [US1] Create Channel assignment model in backend/src/models/assignment.py
- [ ] T018 [US1] Create Channel assignment service in backend/src/services/assignment_service.py
- [ ] T019 [US1] Create Channel assignment API endpoints in backend/src/api/assignments.py
- [ ] T020 [US1] Create Channels page component in frontend/src/pages/ChannelsPage.tsx

- [ ] T025 [US1] Implement channel update functionality in frontend/src/features/channels/
- [ ] T026 [US1] Implement channel deletion functionality in frontend/src/features/channels/
- [ ] T027 [US1] Add validation and error handling for channel operations
- [ ] T028 [US1] Add logging for channel operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Channel Search and Filter (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to search and filter channels based on various criteria like name, status, creation date.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow filtering the channel list by different parameters and return the matching results in a reasonable time.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T029 [P] [US2] Enhance Channel service with search and filter methods in backend/src/services/channel_service.py
- [ ] T030 [US2] Update Channel API endpoints with search and filter parameters in backend/src/api/channels.py
- [ ] T031 [US2] Create Search and Filter UI components in frontend/src/components/SearchFilter.tsx
- [ ] T032 [US2] Integrate search and filter functionality into Channels page
- [ ] T033 [US2] Add pagination support to channel listing
- [ ] T034 [US2] Optimize database queries for search performance
- [ ] T035 [US2] Add search and filter tests to frontend/src/tests/

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Channel Assignment and Permissions (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow admins to assign channels to different users or teams and manage access permissions.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow assigning channels to users and restricting access based on assigned permissions.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T036 [P] [US3] Complete ChannelAssignment model implementation in backend/src/models/assignment.py
- [ ] T037 [US3] Enhance ChannelAssignment service with permission checks in backend/src/services/assignment_service.py
- [ ] T038 [US3] Create assignment-specific API endpoints in backend/src/api/assignments.py
- [ ] T039 [US3] Create Assignment management UI components in frontend/src/components/AssignmentManagement.tsx
- [ ] T040 [US3] Implement permission checking middleware in backend/src/auth/
- [ ] T041 [US3] Integrate assignment functionality into frontend Channels page
- [ ] T042 [US3] Add permission-based access controls to channel operations

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T043 [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] T044 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T045 Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T046 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in backend/tests/unit/ and frontend/src/tests/
- [ ] T047 Security hardening
- [ ] T048 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 models and services
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 models and services

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
