# Implementation Plan: Channel Management System

**Branch**: `001-channel-management` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: [specs/001-channel-management/spec.md](specs/001-channel-management/spec.md)

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive channel management system that allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete channel records. The system will include features for searching, filtering, and assigning channels to users with appropriate permissions. The system will be built as a web application with a backend API and database storage.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, TypeScript 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React.js, PostgreSQL  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database  
**Testing**: pytest, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Linux server, Web browser  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Handle 10,000 channels with search performance under 2 seconds  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 response time for standard operations, <100MB memory usage  
**Scale/Scope**: Support up to 1000 concurrent users, 100,000 channels
