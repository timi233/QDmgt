# Feature Specification: Channel Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-channel-management`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to make a channel management system"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Channel CRUD Operations (Priority: P1)

A system administrator needs to be able to create, read, update, and delete channel records in the system. This includes basic channel information like name, description, status, and contact details.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that all other features will depend on. Without the ability to manage channels, no other functionality is meaningful.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow an admin to create a new channel, view the list of channels, update channel details, and remove channels. This provides the core functionality that justifies the system's existence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I submit channel creation form with valid details, **Then** a new channel should be created and visible in the channel list
2. **Given** channels exist in the system, **When** I request the channel list, **Then** I should see all active channels with their details
3. **Given** a channel exists, **When** I update its details, **Then** the changes should be saved and reflected in the system
4. **Given** a channel exists, **When** I delete it, **Then** it should be removed from the channel list

### User Story 2 - Channel Search and Filter (Priority: P2)

A user needs to search and filter channels based on various criteria like name, status, creation date, etc., to quickly find specific channels in a large dataset.

**Why this priority**: As the system grows with more channels, the ability to quickly locate specific channels becomes critical for usability.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow filtering the channel list by different parameters and return the matching results in a reasonable time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple channels exist, **When** I filter by channel name, **Then** only matching channels should be displayed
2. **Given** channels with different statuses exist, **When** I filter by status, **Then** only channels with that status should be displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Channel Assignment and Permissions (Priority: P3)

An admin needs to assign channels to different users or teams and manage access permissions for those channels.

**Why this priority**: This is an important business functionality that allows proper access control and delegation of channel management responsibilities.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow assigning channels to users and restricting access based on assigned permissions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user exists, **When** I assign a channel to them, **Then** they should be able to access that channel based on their permissions
2. **Given** a channel is assigned to a user, **When** I revoke their access, **Then** they should no longer be able to access that channel

### Edge Cases

- What happens when creating a channel with an already existing name?
- How does the system handle invalid contact information in channel details?
- What if a user tries to access a channel they don't have permissions for?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of channel records with name, description, status, and contact information
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a way to list all channels with pagination support
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow updating channel details for authorized users
- **FR-004**: System MUST support soft deletion of channels to maintain data integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate channel data before saving (e.g., valid email format for contact info)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support searching and filtering channels by name, status, and date range
- **FR-007**: System MUST track channel creation and modification metadata (timestamp, user)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support assigning channels to users/teams with appropriate permissions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Channel**: Represents a communication channel with properties like name, description, status, contact information, creation/modification metadata
- **User**: Represents system users who can be assigned to channels with specific permissions
- **ChannelAssignment**: Represents the relationship between users and channels with access permissions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Admins can create a new channel entry in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: System can handle at least 10,000 channels with search performance under 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete channel creation without errors
- **SC-004**: Channel CRUD operations have 99.9% success rate during normal operation hours
