# Research: Channel Management System

**Feature**: Channel Management System  
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Branch**: 001-channel-management-system

## Decision Log

### 1. Technology Stack Selection

**Decision**: Python FastAPI backend with React.js frontend, PostgreSQL database

**Rationale**: 
- FastAPI provides excellent performance, automatic API documentation, and strong typing
- React.js offers component-based architecture and large ecosystem for building interactive UIs
- PostgreSQL is a robust, scalable open-source database with excellent JSON support and good analytical capabilities for target tracking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node.js + Express + React: Rejected due to potential performance issues with heavy data processing
- Django + DRF: Rejected for being too monolithic when a microservice approach is preferred
- MongoDB: Rejected due to the relational nature of channel assignments and target tracking requirements

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

**Decision**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)

**Rationale**:
- Provides secure session management with server-side control
- RBAC allows fine-grained permission control per the feature requirements
- Better for admin interfaces where security is paramount, especially when managing sensitive business targets

**Alternatives considered**:
- JWT tokens: Rejected due to token revocation complexity for admin scenarios
- OAuth2: Rejected as it's more complex than needed for a single application
- Basic auth: Rejected for security reasons

### 3. Data Modeling Approach

**Decision**: Relational database with normalized schema extended for target planning

**Rationale**:
- The domain has clear relationships between channels, users, assignments, targets, and execution plans
- Ensures data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Supports complex queries for search, filtering, and analytics required for target tracking
- Time dimensions (year, quarter, month) can be properly modeled with relational approach

### 4. API Design Pattern

**Decision**: RESTful API with HATEOAS principles, extended for complex target operations

**Rationale**:
- Familiar pattern for CRUD operations required by the system
- Good caching capabilities
- Standard tooling and documentation approaches
- Can be extended for complex analytics and reporting operations

### 5. Frontend State Management

**Decision**: React Context API with custom hooks for local state, with potential migration to Redux for complex scenarios

**Rationale**:
- Context API is sufficient for the scope of this application
- Avoids unnecessary complexity of external state management libraries initially
- Hooks allow for reusable logic patterns for target planning and execution tracking

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Test-driven development (TDD) with unit, integration, and contract tests

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with project constitution requiring TDD
- Contract tests ensure API consistency between frontend and backend
- Unit and integration tests ensure functionality reliability, especially for critical target calculations

### 7. Target Tracking Implementation

**Decision**: Separate entities for targets and execution plans with time dimension support

**Rationale**:
- Allows tracking of targets across year/quarter/month timeframes
- Enables historical analysis and trend calculations
- Supports multiple metrics (performance, opportunities, project count, development goals)
- Facilitates the required visualizations (pie charts, progress bars, trend charts)

### 8. Visualization Strategy

**Decision**: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization

**Rationale**:
- Chart.js offers good performance with simpler implementation for required charts
- Supports pie charts, progress bars, and trend charts as specified in requirements
- Good integration with React components
- Adequate for the visualization requirements of target achievement tracking
