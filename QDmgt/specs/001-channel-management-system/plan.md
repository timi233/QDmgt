# Implementation Plan: Channel Management System

**Branch**: `001-channel-management-system` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: [specs/001-channel-management-system/spec.md](specs/001-channel-management-system/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-channel-management-system/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive channel management system that allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete channel records. The system will include features for searching, filtering, and assigning channels to users with appropriate RBAC permissions. The system will be built as a web application with a Python FastAPI backend and React.js frontend, using PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (Backend), TypeScript 5.x (Frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (Backend framework), React.js (Frontend framework), SQLAlchemy (ORM), PostgreSQL (Database)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with 1 year retention policy for soft-deleted records  
**Testing**: pytest (Backend), React Testing Library (Frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Backend), Web browsers (Frontend)  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Handle 10,000 channels with search performance under 2 seconds, <200ms p95 response time for standard operations  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 response time, <100MB memory usage per service, support up to 1000 concurrent users  
**Scale/Scope**: Support up to 100,000 channels, 1000 concurrent users, horizontal scaling capability

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the project constitution, the following gates were evaluated after Phase 1 design:

**Passed Requirements:**
- **Test-First**: TDD will be mandatory - contract tests created in /contracts/ and unit tests planned
- **Library-First**: Components designed as standalone, testable modules in service layer
- **CLI Interface**: Core functionality will be accessible through CLI for debugging (planned)
- **Integration Testing**: Contract tests created for API endpoints in /contracts/
- **Observability**: Structured logging planned for implementation

**Post-Design Compliance:**
- All API contracts align with integration testing constitution requirement
- Data models support test-first approach with clear validation rules
- Architecture supports observability requirements with dedicated logging layer
- Target tracking and execution planning features integrated appropriately with existing channel management functionality

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application structure with separate backend and frontend to allow for independent scaling and maintenance. Backend uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM, while frontend uses React with TypeScript. This follows the identified need for a web-based channel management system with RBAC authentication.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No complexity violations identified that require justification at this time. All architectural decisions comply with project constitution principles.
