## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Channel Target Planning and Management (Priority: P1)

A system administrator needs to create, read, update, and delete channel records in the system with target planning capabilities. This includes basic information like name, description, status, contact details, business type (basic, high-value, pending-signup), target metrics (performance, opportunities, project count, development goals), and time dimensions (year, quarter, month) for each channel.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that all other features will depend on. Without the ability to manage channels with target planning, no other functionality is meaningful in the context of channel goal lifecycle management.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow an admin to create a new channel with target planning, view the list of channels with their targets, update channel details and targets, and remove channels. This provides the core functionality for channel goal planning that justifies the system's existence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I submit channel creation form with valid details and target planning, **Then** a new channel should be created and visible in the channel list
2. **Given** channels exist in the system, **When** I request the channel list, **Then** I should see all active channels with their details and targets
3. **Given** a channel exists, **When** I update its target metrics, **Then** the changes should be saved and reflected in the system
4. **Given** a channel exists, **When** I delete it, **Then** it should be removed from the channel list

### User Story 2 - Channel Search, Filter and Target Tracking (Priority: P2)

A user needs to search and filter channels based on various criteria like name, status, business type (basic, high-value, pending-signup), target completion status, time dimensions, and performance metrics to quickly find specific channels in a large dataset and track their target achievement.

**Why this priority**: As the system grows with more channels and targets, the ability to quickly locate specific channels and track their target achievement becomes critical for usability.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow filtering the channel list by different parameters including target dimensions and return the matching results with target completion status in a reasonable time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple channels exist, **When** I filter by channel name, **Then** only matching channels should be displayed with their target status
2. **Given** channels with different business types exist, **When** I filter by business type, **Then** only channels of that type should be displayed with their target progress

---

### User Story 3 - Channel Assignment and Execution Tracking (Priority: P3)

An admin needs to assign channels to different users or teams with target management responsibilities and track monthly/weekly execution progress for those channels.

**Why this priority**: This is an important business functionality that allows proper access control and delegation of channel target management responsibilities with execution tracking capabilities.

**Independent Test**: The system should allow assigning channels to users, restricting access based on assigned permissions, and tracking monthly/weekly execution progress against targets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user exists, **When** I assign a channel to them, **Then** they should be able to access that channel based on their permissions and update execution progress
2. **Given** a channel is assigned to a user, **When** I revoke their access, **Then** they should no longer be able to access that channel or update its execution status

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when creating a channel with an already existing name? The system should prevent creation of channels with duplicate names and show an appropriate error message.
- How does the system handle invalid contact information in channel details?
- What if a user tries to access a channel they don't have permissions for?

- **FR-003**: System MUST allow updating channel details and target metrics for authorized users
- **FR-004**: System MUST support soft deletion of channels to maintain data integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate channel data before saving (e.g., valid email format for contact info)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support searching and filtering channels by name, status, business type, and target achievement
- **FR-007**: System MUST track channel creation and modification metadata (timestamp, user)
